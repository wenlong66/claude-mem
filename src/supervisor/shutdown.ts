/**
 * Owner-guarded PID-file removal (Phase 5, worker-restart plan).
 *
 * The shutdown cascade is the dying worker's LAST act — during a restart the
 * successor worker has typically already written its OWN PID file by the time
 * this runs. Blindly rmSync'ing here clobbered that file and made
 * `worker status` report a healthy worker as not running. Deletion therefore
 * requires proof of ownership: the recorded pid must equal `currentPid`.
 *
 * With `deleteIfDead` (the CLI stop/restart cleanup policy — see
 * removePidFileIfOwner in ProcessManager.ts) a dead or missing recorded pid is
 * also deleted: a pid-less file can't belong to a live successor
 * (writePidFile always records a pid), so it is treated as a dead owner.
 * Without it, only the caller's own file is ever deleted.
 *
 * A missing file is a no-op. An unreadable/corrupt file cannot prove
 * ownership, so it is left in place (the safe default): readPidFile() and
 * validateWorkerPidFile() both treat unparseable files as ownerless, so a
 * leftover corrupt file never blocks a successor's boot and is cleaned up by
 * the next worker start.
