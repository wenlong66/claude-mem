 * cmem Pro trial promo copy — the single source of truth for every place

 *
 * Almost nobody running the free plugin knows the trial is there, so the pitch
 * rides along with the messages they already read: the session-start banner,
 * the per-message context banner, the first-session welcome hint, the installer
 * "Next Steps" block, and the viewer header. Keeping the wording and the URL
 * here means the funnel copy changes in one edit instead of five.
 *
 * The viewer keeps its own copy in `src/ui/viewer/constants/promo.ts` — its
 * tsconfig pins rootDir to the viewer directory, so it cannot import this file.
 * Change both together.
